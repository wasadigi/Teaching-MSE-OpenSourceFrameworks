/**
 * This is an example for a Transfer Object, which will be used to send data to the client.
 * Instances of this class will be created from JPA entities, but will not expose all attributes.
 * In this example, we do not want to send salary information to everyone, so we have stripped
 * this information. In some cases, a transfer object may also be used to aggregate properties from
 * several JPA entities.
 * 
 * The class must have an empty constructor, as well as getters and setters for properties (this
 * is required for the JAXB marshalling to work properly). That is also why we have the @XmlRootElement
 * annotation at the class level.
